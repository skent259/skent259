### Hi! I'm Sean Kent ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and I love to write code at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and new research.  You can see more of my experience, background, and blog posts on my website: <http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kent/>.  Here, I'll highlight a few of my favorite code projects.

## SVM-based algorithms for Multiple Instance Learning

[`mildsvm`](https://github.com/skent259/mildsvm) is an R package that implements functions to train a variety of models for multiple instance learning, a subset of machine learning where rows of data are grouped into bags and only outcomes on the bags are observed.  This incorporates methods proposed by our reserach where instances can be thought of as probability distributions and where the outcome label is ordinal.  It also includes previous SVM-based algorithms from the literature, including Andrews, Tsochantaridis, and Hofmann (2003) [Support Vector Machines for Multiple-Instance Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2002/file/3e6260b81898beacda3d16db379ed329-Paper.pdf) and Xiao, Liu, and Hao (2018) [Multiple-Instance Ordinal Regression](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8107717?casa_token=-My_3w0W9PsAAAAA:3kuIvYYIFWOpNVCQl4rpI5iFBPPqdaQV57MRbC0GfWPbN45Za8YApt6-YjCeB6PomsehPuG0XjE).  This package can be installed via `install_github("skent259/mildsvm")`.  

## Causal Matching for Longitudinal Data

[`rsmatch`](https://github.com/skent259/rsmatch) is an R package designed to perform Risk Set Matching. Risk set matching is useful for causal inference in longitudinal studies where subjects are treated at varying time points. The main idea is that treated subjects can match with anyone who hasn't yet been treated and those who never get treatment, but each subject can only be used in one pair. This creates a mixed-integer programming problem that we implement based on Li, Propert, and Rosenbaum (2001) [Balanced Risk Set Matching](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214501753208573). This package can be installed via `install_github("skent259/rsmatch")`.  

## Simulate the Game of Craps

I don't gamble often&mdash;but I find craps to be the most entertaining way to lose money in a casino.  As a side-project, I developed a simulator in python ([skent259/CrapsSim](https://github.com/skent259/CrapsSim)) to test various betting strategies. With it, I analyzed the best craps strategies for players on a budget, published on [my blog](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kent/blog/2019.07.31_Craps_Budget/craps_best-strategies-on-a-budget.html).

The rest of my repositories are a mixture of machine learning implementations, visualizations from other contexts, talks that I've given, and more.  Feel free to check out those projects below!
